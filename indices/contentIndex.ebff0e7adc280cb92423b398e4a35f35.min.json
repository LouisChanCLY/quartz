This means it can be used with any machine learning algorithm\n- Only the complexity for [[TreeSHAP]] is impacted by depth (D). On the other hand, only [[KernelSHAP]] is impacted by the number of features (M). The difference is that [[KernelSHAP]] complexity is exponential w.r.t M and [[TreeSHAP]] is quadratic w.r.t D. Considering that we also had more features (M = 10) than tree depth (D= 4), we can see why [[KernelSHAP]] was slower.\n- Before making your choice, there are some other differences that you might want to consider. These include the fact that [[KernelSHAP]] is model agnostic, the methods are impacted by feature dependencies and only [[TreeSHAP]] can be used to calculate interaction effects.\n- Neural networks also have their own approximation methods. You can use [[DeepSHAP]] for these algorithms.\n- Feature dependencies can skew the approximations made by [[KernelSHAP]]. The algorithm estimates [[SHAP]] values by randomly sampling feature values.\n- That is a feature that has no impact on the prediction can get a [[SHAP]] value that is non-zero. This can happen when the feature is correlated with another feature that does impact the prediction.\n- [[SHAP]] interaction values you will have to use [[TreeSHAP]]\n\n\n#todo/next-action \n- [ ] Translate content of [[KernelSHAP vs TreeSHAP]] into knowledge graph","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T22:08:42.473234007Z","tags":null},"/%EF%B8%8F-areas/Inbox/Atomic-Habits":{"title":"","content":"Association: [[Atomic Habits]] [[Personal growth]]\n\nGoals are about the results you want to achieve.

In this blog, we will look into how to call a function by its name.\n\n## Calling Functions\n\nSay you have a function `def f(): pass`.\n\nCan you call the function using just `\"f\"`?\n\nOr in a more complicated case, if you have `f1()`, `f2()`, and `f3()`, and users will be choosing which function by typing in a string, how can that be done?\n\n## Solution 1: Locals \u0026 Globals\n\nBefore we dive into `locals` and `globals`, it is important to have some understanding on what [[Namespace]] is. In a Python runtime, all the defined object (class, function, variable, etc.) are mapped and stored in a dictionary, a.k.a. the namespace.\n\n`locals()` returns the namespace at a local level - say local variables defined in a function, which will then be part of the [[Local Namespace]] within the function.\n\n`globals()` returns the namespace at a global level - say modules imported globally or objects defined globally, which will then be part of the [[Global Namespace]], be it within or outside the function.\n\nLet's say there is a function named `my_function`. \n\n```python\ndef my_function(a, b, c):\n\t\tpass\n```\n\nTo call the function with `\"my_function\"` using `locals` and `globals`:\n\n```python\ns = \"my_function\"\n\n# calling the function from local namespace\nfunction = locals()[s]\nfunction(a=1, b=2, c=3)\n\n# calling the function from global namespace\nfunction = globals()[s]\nfunction(a=1, b=2, c=3)\n```\n\nThis method with globals/locals is good if the method you need to call is defined in the same namespace you are calling from.\n\ndictionary that represents the current symbol table of the given source code\ndifference in namespace\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals\nreturn dictionary of local namespace i.e. with local objects\n\n```python\nlocals()[\"myfunction\"]()\n```\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals\nreturn dictionary of global namespace i.e. with global objects\n\n```python\nglobals()[\"myfunction\"]()\n```\n\n## Solution 2: Eval\n\nThe next option is the well-known `eval`, a built-in python function that evaluates an arbitrary string expression/compiled code and execute if it is a legal Python expression.\n\n```python\neval(expression[, globals[, locals]])\n```\n\nTo use `eval`, you only need up to three arguments:\n- Expression: the string expression/compiled code that you wan it to evaluate\n- Globals: optional dictionary that provides a global namespace to `eval`\n- Locals: optional dictionary that provides a local namespace to `eval`\n\n\u003e When globals and locals are provided, they are the namespaces of which `eval` will run based on. Otherwise, `eval` will use the global and local namespaces that your current code is based on \n\n```python\ns = \"my_function\"\n\n# calling the function using eval\nfunction = eval(s)\nfunction(a=1, b=2, c=3)\n\n# you can also run the function directly\nresult = eval(s)(a=1, b=2, c=3)\n```\n\n## Solution 3: Method Caller\n\nAnother method (no pun intended) for doing so is in one of Python's standard library - `operator.methodcaller`. Unlike the above options, `methodcaller` fetch you a callable from an object provided. Hence, the following would not work:\n\n```python\nfrom operator import methodcaller\nbar = methodcaller(\"myfunction\")\nbar()\n```\n\nInstead, the callable needs to be part of an object:\n\n```python\nfrom operator import methodcaller\nfoo = \"bar\"\n\n# upper is a method of a string object\nfoo_method = methodcaller(\"upper\")\nfoo_method(foo)\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 'BAR'\n```\n\nAnother key difference between `methodcaller` and other options is that any arguments would need to be provided in advance. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom operator import methodcaller\nimport random\n\n# This doesn't work\nfoo_method = methodcaller(\"randint\")\nfoo_method(random)\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e TypeError: randint() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'a' and 'b'\n\n# This doesn't work either\nfoo_method = methodcaller(\"randint\")\nfoo_method(random, a=1, b=2)\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e TypeError: methodcaller() takes no keyword arguments\n\n# This works!\nfoo_method = methodcaller(\"randint\", a=1, b=2)\nfoo_method(random)\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 1\n```\n\nTherefore, to use `methodcaller`, you would need to first be mindful of:\n- the location of the method (e.g. which module/class is the method under)\n- whether arguments are required to use that method\n\n## Solution 4: Get Attribute\n\nJust like `operator.methodcaller`, `getattr` is another option that requires prior knowledge of where the method reside. That being said, there are two major differences between the two options:\n1. `getattr` does not restrict to getting a callable. When using it, do be mindful of whether the object returned is callable or not.\n2. `getattr` allows you to pass arguments to the returned method while `methodcaller` requires you to provide it in advance.\n\n```python\nimport random\nbar = getattr(random, 'randint')\nresult = bar(1, 2)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 2\n```\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nJust because you can do it doesn't mean that you should do it.\n\nAllowing users of a script to dictate the behaviour it using a user-provided string can lead to some undesirable security loophole. Some other infamous security loopholes stemmed from treating unparameterised data as code includes XSS and SQL injection. That being said, Python itself being an interpreted language means there are lower level changes that one can make to create even bigger vulnerability.\n\nIn short, in this tutorial, we have walked through four ways that you can call a method using a string. As a quick revision, here is a table that summarises their behaviours:\n\n| Method                | Requires knowledge of location of method      | Return type | Ability to set argument in advance | Ability to set argument after returning |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| `locals` or `globals` | Not as long as the method is in the namespace | Any         | No                                 | Yes                                     |\n| `eval`                | Not as long as the method is in the namespace | Any         | Yes (as arbitrary string)          | Yes                                     |\n| `methodcaller`        | Yes                                           | Callable    | Yes                                | No                                      |\n| `getattr`             | Yes                                           | Any         | No                                 | Yes                                     | \n\nThat‚Äôs about it for this blog post!

Stein methods are a promising family of algorithms for approximate bayesian inference. The basic idea is to create a system of particles and optimize the system so the set of particles represents the properties of the posterior. For example, SVGD like VI tries to minimise the [[KL Divergence]] but in a non-parametric way. This approach leverages both sampling and optimisation. The drawback of SVGD is being sensitive to the chosen kernel which is used to realize the geometry of space. NVGD has been proposed to address this problem, so it can capture the geometry automatically.  \n  \nSome probabilistic programming languages like PyMC3 and Pyro have already implemented some algorithms of this family.\n\nStein Variational Gradient Descent: A General Purpose Bayesian Inference Algorithm, 2016  \nArxiv:¬†[https://lnkd.in/eWSFT4SJ](https://lnkd.in/eWSFT4SJ)\n\nNeural Variational Gradient Descent, 2021  \nArxiv:¬†[https://lnkd.in/eNWpyq9P](https://lnkd.in/eNWpyq9P)\n\nStein methods in Pyro:¬†[https://lnkd.in/eRWyYYjS](https://lnkd.in/eRWyYYjS)\n\nSVGD in PyMC:¬†[https://lnkd.in/eTchSAxF](https://lnkd.in/eTchSAxF)","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T22:08:42.473234007Z","tags":null},"/%EF%B8%8F-areas/Inbox/Surjective-Function":{"title":"","content":"\n## Metadata\n- Association: [[Set Theory]] [[Injective Function]] [[Bijective Function]]\n- Domain: [[Domain Root - Mathematics]]\n\n## Surjective Function","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T22:08:42.477234024Z","tags":null},"/-resources/Logs/AEIOU-log-copy":{"title":"","content":"**Explanation:**\n\n**A = Activities.** \"What were you actually doing?

In this context, the game for SHAP is sat up as follows:\n\n- **Game Objective:** Reproduce the output of the model\n- **Players:** Features included in the model\n\nIn essence, SHAP is quantifying the contribution of each feature on the prediction output of the model i.e. **local interpretability**\n## How it works?\n\nAssume $F$ be the number of features of a model\n\n1. Create [[Power Set]] of all features (i.e. [[Cardinality]] of $2^F$)\n2. Train a predictive model for each coalition of the power set (i.e. $2^F$ models) with the exact same [[Hyperparameter]] and [[Training Data]] as the origin predictive model\n3. Run an observation through model inference for all the above models\n4. Compute the marginal contributions of each feature under different coalition set\n5. Compute the weighted sum of marginal contributions for each feature using the following formula:\n\n$$SHAP_{feature}(s) = \\sum_{\\mathclap{set:feature \\in set}}[|set| \\times \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ |set| \\end{pmatrix}]^{-1}[Predict_{set}(x) - Predict_{set\\backslash feature}(x)]$$\n\n## Example Walkthrough\n\nAssumes a predictive model uses $Age$, $Gender$, and $Job$ for predicting some other socio-ecomonic status of a person. (i.e. $F=3$). The [[Power Set]] of all feature will be as follows:\n\n![[Pasted image 20220720221454.png]]\n\nFor each node above, a predictive model with the same [[Hyperparameter]] and [[Training Data]] is trained. For an observation vector $x_0$, the inference results for the eight models are as follows:\n\n![[Pasted image 20220720221729.png]]\n\nTo compute the marginal contribution for feature $Age$, we will need to compute the following:\n$$\\begin{cases}\nMC_{Age, \\{Age\\}}(x_0) = Predict_{\\{Age\\}}(x_0) - Predict_\\varnothing(x_0) = 40k - 50k = -10k \\\\\nMC_{Age, \\{Age, Gender\\}}(x_0) = Predict_{\\{Age, Gender\\}}(x_0) - Predict_{\\{Gender\\}}(x_0) = 39k - 48k = -9k \\\\\nMC_{Age, \\{Age, Job\\}}(x_0) = Predict_{\\{Age, Job\\}}(x_0) - Predict_{\\{Job\\}}(x_0) = 85k - 100k = -12k \\\\\nMC_{Age, \\{Age, Gender, Job\\}}(x_0) = Predict_{\\{Age, Gender, Job\\}}(x_0) - Predict_{\\{Gender, Job\\}}(x_0) = 83k - 95k = -12k\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n![[Pasted image 20220720222550.png]]\n\nThe corresponding weights $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$, and $w_4$ are then computed as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}\nw_1 = [1 \\times \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}]^{-1} = 1/3 \\\\\nw_2 = [2 \\times \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}]^{-1} = 1/6 \\\\\nw_3 = [2 \\times \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}]^{-1} = 1/6 \\\\\nw_4 = [3 \\times \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}]^{-1} = 1/3 \\\\\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n![[Pasted image 20220720223157.png]]\n\nTo put it simply, the weight for a coalition with cardinality $f$ will be the reciprocal of the number of possible marginal contributions to all the¬†models with $f$ features.\n\n\u003e Note that all the weights for a feature $f$ should sum up to 1\n\nWith the weights, the SHAP value for $Age$ on observation $x_0$ can then be calculated as follows:\n\n$$SHAP_{Age}(x) = \n\\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \u0026 w_2 \u0026 w_3 \u0026 w_4 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \n\\begin{bmatrix} MC_{Age, \\{Age\\}}(x_0) \\\\ MC_{Age, \\{Age, Gender\\}}(x_0) \\\\ MC_{Age, \\{Age, Job\\}}(x_0) \\\\ MC_{Age, \\{Age, Gender, Job\\}}(x_0) \\end{bmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1/3 \u0026 1/6 \u0026 1/6 \u0026 1/3 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \n\\begin{bmatrix} -10k \\\\ -9k \\\\ -15k \\\\ -12k \\end{bmatrix}\n= -11.33k$$\n\nRepeating it for the other features would get $SHAP_{Gender}(x_0) = -2.33k$ and $SHAP_{Job}(x_0) = 46.66k$. Summing all three SHAP values would give $33k$ which is the different between the output of the full model (${Age, Gender, Job}$) at $83k$, and the output of the dummy model ($\\varnothing$) at $50k$.\n\n## Approximation of SHAP\n\nAs illustrated above, the original SHAP algorithm does not scale well and would suffer from [[Curse of Dimensionalities]] as $2^F$ models would need to be trained to explain a $F$-feature-model. As such, the following approximation algorithms have been derived for different situations:\n\n- [[KernelSHAP]]: model agnostic approximation of SHAP with time complexity more dependent on number of features\n- [[TreeSHAP]]: approximation of SHAP for tree-based models with time complexity more dependent on number of trees and tree depth\n- [[DeepSHAP]]: approximation of SHAP for [[Neural Network]]\n\n## Feature Dependencies\n\n## Interaction Effects\n\n## Alternatives to SHAP\n\n## Comparison of SHAP Options\n\n| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Applicability |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [[KernelSHAP]] | $O(TL2^M)$ | Model Agnostic |\n| [[TreeSHAP]] | $O(TLD^2)$ | Tree-based Models Only |","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T22:08:42.473234007Z","tags":null},"/-resources/Wiki/Explainable-AI/TreeSHAP":{"title":"","content":"## Metadata\n- Association: [[KernelSHAP vs TreeSHAP]]\n- Domain: [[Domain Root - Data Science]]\n\n## TreeSHAP","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T22:08:42.473234007Z","tags":null},"/-resources/Wiki/Genetic-Algorithm":{"title":"","content":"\n## Metadata\n- Association:\n- Domain: [[Domain Root - Data Science]]\n\n## Genetic Algorithm\n\nInspired by [[Charles Darwin]]‚Äôs [[Theory of Evolution]], the Genetic Algorithm is an¬†iterative process for search the global optimal solution to a problem statement. To better understand how a genetic algorithm works, here is a short crash course of the key concepts:\n\n-   **Gene:**¬†This refers to a parameter/variable of the solution. It is quite usual for a gene to be¬†represented as a bit (i.e. 0 or 1), but that can be changed based on the underlying problem statement.\n-   **Individual / Chromosome:**¬†A string of genes that represents a solution.\n-   **Population:**¬†One generation of individuals.\n-   **[[Fitness Function]]:**¬†A function for calculating how successful (**Fitness Score**) an individual is. Depending on the underlying problem statement, we can search for individuals with the highest fitness score or the lowest. To embrace the concept of survival of the fittest, the better the fitness score, the¬†higher the chance that an individual can survive and reproduce to form the next generation.\n-   **[[Selection Strategy]]:**¬†This defines how we compare individuals against each other for selection the seeds for the next generation. Some common examples are¬†[**[[Tournament Selection Strategy]]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_selection)¬†(a random sample of individuals face each other 1 v 1, and the winner wins a place in the next generation),¬†[**[[Roulette Proportionate Selection Strategy]]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection)¬†(probability be chosen is proportional to the fitness score), or¬†**double tournaments**¬†for more complex scenarios\n-   **[[Crossover Strategy]]:**¬†This is essentially how parent genes are passed to offspring when reproducing.¬†Crossover is supposed to mimic sexual reproduction, where two parents are needed for reproducing.¬†Genes of the parents will then be recombined to form offspring. Although different strategies are depending on scenario and data types, the most common two are¬†[[K-Point Crossover]] and [[Uniform Crossover]] In the [[K-Point Crossover]],¬†k¬†_crossover point(s)_¬†will be selected randomly, where the genes to the right of a point are swapped. [[Uniform Crossover]] is relatively more straightforward: instead of having¬†sections of genes swapped, every gene will¬†have the same chance to be swapped.\n![[Pasted image 20220719222606.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20220719222614.png]]\n-   **[[Mutation Strategy]]:**¬†As a way to maintain gene diversity and prevent premature convergence,¬†genes of the children will have a random chance of mutating, meaning that the actual value will deviate from that of the parents.¬†Mutation usually comes in the form of¬†[**[[Bit-Flipping Mutation Strategy]]**](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/tools.html#deap.tools.mutFlipBit),¬†[**[[Index-Shuffling Mutation Strategy]]**](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/tools.html#deap.tools.mutShuffleIndexes), or¬†**[[Bounded Mutation Strategy]]**¬†and¬†**[[Unbounded Mutation Strategy]]**.\n\n## Flow of Genetic Algorithm\n\nThese key concepts will then be combined to form an iterative algorithm:\n\n1.  Parameterise the problem statement\n2.  Define a [[Fitness Function]]\n3.  Define a [[Crossover Strategy]], a [[Mutation Strategy]], and a [[Selection Strategy]]\n4.  Generate initial population\n5.  Evaluate the fitness of the individuals of the population\n6.  Select the individuals, crossover and mutate to form the next generation of population\n7.

These weights will be used for computing the very first batch of scores before being updated by [[Backward Propagation]] after lost/cost has been computed.\n\nInitialising weights for [[Neural Network]] are usually as simple as a oneliner:\n```python\n# one-liner weight initialisation for tensorflow\ntf.keras.initializers.RandomUniform(minval=-0.05, maxval=0.05, seed=None)\n```\n\n## Rule of Thumb for Weight Initialisation\n\nAs deep learning models get more and more complex, the problem of [[Vanishing Gradient]] and [[Exploding Gradient]] will only be more pronounced.¬†**A general rule of thumb for initialising weights is to (1) make it random, (2) have a stable variance for each layer, and (3) potentially make the distribution symmetric.**¬†Based on that, there has been a lot of excellent work dedicated to weight initialisation aiming at better and¬†**faster convergence with reduced gradient problems**. Here are two of the more common initialisation methods that you may find useful for building your own deep learning models:\n\n1. -   **[[He Initialisation]]**¬†[**(He et al. 2015)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852)**:**¬†This is more suited for initialising weights for [[ReLu]] and [[Leaky ReLu]] [[Activation Function]].\n   $$W^{[l]} = N(0, \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{size^{[l-1]}}})$$\n3. -   **[[Xavier Initialisation]]**¬†[**(Glorot et al. 2010)**](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf)**:**¬†This is more suited for initialising weights for [[Hyperbolic Tangent]] [[Activation Function]]\n   $$W^{[l]} = N(0, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{size^{[l-1]}}})$$\n\nThat being said, there are some common pitfalls when it comes to [[Neural Network]] initialisation.\n\n## [[Zero Initialisation]] - [[Symmetry Problem]]\n\n- **When does it happen:** All initialised weights of a [[Neural Network]] is zero.\n- **Result:** The [[Neural Network]] will become a **[[Linear Model]]**\n\nOne of the strengths of [[Neural Network]] are their [[Non-linearity]]. By setting all the weights to zero, all the [[Partial Derivatives]] in [[Backward Propagation]] will be the same for every neuron. While this won't break the algorithm, this will stall learning progress as all neurons in the same layer will be learning the same parameter.\n\n## Too-small Initialisation - [[Vanishing Gradient]]\n-   **Why does it happen:**¬†Initialised weights of a neural network are too small\n-   **Result:**¬†Premature convergence\n-   **Symptoms:**¬†Model performance improves very slowly during training. The training process is also likely to stop very early.\n\nIf the initial weights of the neurons are too small relative to the inputs, the¬†**gradient of the hidden layers will diminish exponentially as we propagate backward**. Or you may also say, vanishing through the layers. To better understand that, let‚Äôs assume that we have a three-layer fully connected neural network below where every layer has a sigmoid activation function with zero bias:\n\n![[Pasted image 20220719212521.png]]\n\nIf we quickly recall how a [[Sigmoid]] function and its derivates look like, we can see that the maximum value of the derivative (i.e. gradient) of the sigmoid function is at 0.25 when $x=0$. For reference, derivative of a [[Sigmoid]] function is $\\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$.\n\nWhen training a model using [[Gradient Descent]], we will be updating the weights of the entire neural network using [[Backward Propagation]] by taking partial derivatives of the loss values with respect to the weights of each layer. To take the partial derivates for the network we have above, we need to first know about the mathematical expression of it. Assuming\n\n-   $a$¬†stands for the output vector of activation function,\n-   $sigma$¬†stands for the sigmoid function (i.e. our activation function),\n-   $z$ stands for the output of the neurons of a layer, and\n-   $W$¬†stands for the vector of weights of each layer\n\nthe output of the neural network above can be represented as follows:\n\n$$\\hat{y} = a^{[3]} = \\sigma z^{[3]} = \\sigma W^{[3]} a^{[2]} = ... = \\sigma W^{[3]} \\sigma W^{[2]} \\sigma W^{[1]} x$$\n\nHence, the partial derivative for updating $W^{[1]}$, weights in the first layer, will be as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial W^{[1]}} = \\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial a^{[3]}}\\frac{\\partial a^{[3]}}{\\partial z^{[3]}}\\frac{\\partial z^{[3]}}{\\partial a^{[2]}}\\frac{\\partial a^{[2]}}{\\partial z^{[2]}}\\frac{\\partial z^{[2]}}{\\partial a^{[1]}}\\frac{\\partial a^{[1]}}{\\partial z^{[1]}}\\frac{\\partial z^{[1]}}{\\partial W^{[1]}}$$\n\n#todo ==Find more intuitive explanation for this please!==\n\n**Ways to alleviate vanishing gradient can be:**\n\n-   LSTM can solve the vanishing gradient problem with its gates\n-   Use activation function like ReLu or leaky ReLu which are both less prone to vanishing gradient\n-   Reduce the number of layers\n-   Randomly initialize weights at a sufficiently large expected value\n\n## Too-large Initialisation ‚Äî [[Exploding Gradient]]\n\n-   **When does it happen:**¬†Initialised weights of a neural network are too large\n-   **Result:**¬†Loss value will oscillate around minima but unable to converge\n-   **Symptoms:**¬†The model will have large changes in its loss value on each update due to its instability.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-31T22:08:42.461233955Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
