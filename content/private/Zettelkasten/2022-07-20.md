## ✍️ Morning Writing
I'm feeling like I am slowly getting into this new habit. I have been organising my bed and try to leave bed/at least sit up as soon as I wake up. Instead of just spending time in bed scrolling through YouTube and Instagram, I am now spending a tiny bit of time on writing this paragraph. That being said, I am still not very productive when I first wake up (reasonably). I hope I can keep up my morning exercise routine and do at least some workout even when my meetings are earlier than usual. Later this afternoon, I will be meeting [[@Robert Hardman]] at [[Black Sheep Coffee]]. My gut feeling is that he might have already left [[Kidsloop]] or at least been put on garden leave. Nonetheless, Robert has been such a good mentor to me that if he presents a decent opportunity with the possibility of visa sponsorship, I might just join him.
