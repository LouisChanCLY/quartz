## ✍️ Morning Writing
Today I am feeling great! I can feel the tension and fatigue in my chest and back, meaning my workout is working. It is [[@Kelly]]'s first day as a nurse today. She seems to be very anxious, blaming herself for a number of accidents that caused her quite a lot of time in the traffic jam. Hope everything went well in the end!
