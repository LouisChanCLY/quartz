## ✍️ Morning Writing
I'm feeling mixed. On one hand, I am feeling great for getting fitter on a daily basis. But at the same time, I can feel more hair loss and work is dragging my to do list behind. I know the later is probably excuse and I just need to find a way to stop procrastination. Not sure how to start, but I will try my best. So far, putting headphone on seems to be my game mode where I can focus better. Let's keep experimenting!
