## ✍️ Morning Writing
I'm feeling refreshed today, but at the same time a slight bit of mellowness. We have received the long awaited film photos from our surprise proposal and they are absolutely amazing. But at the same time, work isn't progressing the smoothest. There is a general toxic vibe in [[ESG IQ]] where the senior management are absorbing themselves from responsibilities and push the pointed blame to myself and the developers. The move to KPMG may not be the wisest move, but I am glad that my friends from [[FTI]], [[@Claudio Calvino]], [[@Dimitri Korres]], and [[@Lara Rachidi]] are all trying their best to help me achieve my dream of attempting to make material impact via coding.
