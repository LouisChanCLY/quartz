**Explanation:**

**A = Activities.** "What were you actually doing? Was this a structured or an unstructured activity? Did you have a specific role to play or were you just a participant?"
**E = Environments.** "Our environment has a profound effect on our emotional state. You feel one way at a football stadium, another in a cathedral. Notice where you were when you were involved in the activity. What kind of a place was it, and how did it make you feel?"
**I = Interactions.** "What were you interacting with - people or machines? Was it a new kind of interaction or one you are familiar with? Was it formal or informal?"
**O = Objects.** "Were you interacting with any objects or devices? What were the objects that created or supported your feeling engaged?"
**U = Users.** "Who else was there, and what role did they play in making it either a positive or a negative experience?"
