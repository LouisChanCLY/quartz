## ✍️ Morning Writing
This morning I am a bit exhausted. Possibly because my back is still aching... is it muscle ache or is it back ache? Had a decent haircut yesterday, a bit pricy but quite decent. also bought some very good pork collar yesterday, trying the same recipe on it. Let's see if the meat comes out more tender and juicy!
