## ✍️ Morning Writing
I'm feeling a bit sorry for what I said yesterday to [[@Kelly]]. On one hand I do think that sometimes she is not very supportive of me, but at the same time, there are better ways to express my feelings. Is it my fault or her fault? That's surely something we will need to learn together. Anyway, enough of that. Another thought that is in my mind is that my todo list is ever growing... glad that I have not added new ideas to it for the past couple of days... But I really need to finish a couple items to get into a good habit of actually burning things down...
