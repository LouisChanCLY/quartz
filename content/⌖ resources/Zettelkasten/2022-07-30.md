## ✍️ Morning Writing
Yesterday I had a good catch up with [[@Niall O'riodan]]. It has been a year since we last spoke to each other. [[@Lara Rachidi]] is now buying a place, getting mortgage, Niall is changing his job, everyone's life is speeding up. I have got to sort my career out as well. I started with a high note, But I need to sustain it. Either way, focusing more on the positive side. I have got to go enjoy some popeyes fried chicken today!!
