## Pythagorean Expectation
Pythagorean Expectation is a formula derived by [[Bill James]] to approximate the win percentage of baseball teams. The formula is as follows:

$Win Percentage = \frac{score^2}{score^2 + score conceded^2}$

## Application
In [[Pythagorean Expectation in Sports Analytics With Examples From Different Sports]] and [[English Premier League (EPL) Pythagorean Predictor]], the author attempted to use Pythagorean Expectation for predicting win percentage of [[English Premier League]] teams, [[MLB]] teams, [[NBA]] teams, and [[Indian Premier League]] teams. 

The preliminary outcome indicates that Pythagorean Expectation is generally a better estimator compared against historical win rate. The experiment has also concluded that the formula is still best suited for baseball. To this, the author has given a couple of possible explanations:
- Breadth and depth of data
- Rules and nature of sport
