## Relative Complement

Relative complement is a common operation in [[Set Theory]] where $A - B$ is defined as any element in $A$ that is not in $B$ (i.e. $A \cap \neg B$).

## Complement

Taking the logical expression of relative complement - $A \cap \neg B$, that means for relative complement to be expressed in the form of an intersection, $\neg B$ - everything that is not B - would need to be defined first.

The term everything in [[Set Theory]] means all the objects in the problem, i.e. [[Universal Set]] $U$. As such, the complement of B ($\neg B$) can be rewritten as $U - B$, making $A - B$ equivalent to $A \cap (U - B)$ or in other words, $A \cap \neg B$.
