## Universal Set

For a fixed class of objects, there is a universal set $U$ which is the grand-set that contains all the elements for that particular problem space.

For example, if the problem space is strictly English alphabets in lowercase, then the universal set $U$ would contain 26 lowercase alphabets.

Unlike [[Empty Set]], as universal set $U$ contains an element for a problem space of non-zero [[Cardinality]], there can be multiple universal sets.
