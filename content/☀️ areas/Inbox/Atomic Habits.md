Association: [[Atomic Habits]] [[Personal growth]]

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard a. The only way to actually win is to get better each day.

Archiving a goal is only a momentary change

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Decide the type of person you want to be.
Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Make it obvious
Make it attractive
Make it easy
Make it satisfying

Implementation intention formula: I will BEHAVIOUR at TIME in LOCATION 
Habbit stacking: after CURRENT HABIT, I will NEXT HABIT

go to bed only when the, develop context that bed is for rest, easier to sleep, associate bed with sleep

Break down habits into context, e.g bedroom for rest living room for relax etc

Make the cue and context for good habits obvious, make the cue and context for bad habits invisible

Pair an action you need to do with something you love to do
Join the culture of the behaviour you want
Create motivation ritual

Break good habit down into symbolic two minutes task e.g. put on running shoes
Slowly scale it up
